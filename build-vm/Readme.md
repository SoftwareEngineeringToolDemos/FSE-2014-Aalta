#Steps to create Virtual Machine using Vagrant
1. Download and Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) on the host machine.
2. Download and Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on the host machine.
3. Create a new directory on your machine and download this [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos/FSE-2014-RefDistiller/blob/master/build-vm/Vagrantfile) into that directory.
4. Navigate to the directory and run the command "vagrant up".
5. The command "vagrant up" will create a Ubuntu (64-bit) virtual machine with gcc and g++ compilers along with the make 
  utility installed in it.

#Note
* Please wait until "vagrant up" command has completed successfully before using the virtual machine.
* VM login details if required:</br>
User     : vagrant</br>
Password : vagrant
